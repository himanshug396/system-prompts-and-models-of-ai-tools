Nestjs has a way to implement Swagger, but an open Swagger without authentication is a security risk.

Use samples 11-swagger and 19-auth-jwt for this task. 
Make changes to the auth module and implement Swagger with proper bearer auth.

Specific changes to be made:
1. Keep the auth sample project as it is and refactor main.ts and other necessary files in the auth project to implement SwaggerModule.
2. Add appropriate definition for addBearerAuth, addSecurityRequirements(), and persistAuthorization in Document Builder that ensures passing JWT access_token in swagger UI.


Rubric:
1. Ensure 19-auth-jwt/package.json has dependency @nestjs/swagger
2. Validate “import { DocumentBuilder, SwaggerModule } from '@nestjs/swagger'” exists in 19-auth-jwt/src/main.ts
3. 19-auth-jwt/src/main.ts has DocumentBuilder.addBearerAuth({type: 'http', scheme: 'bearer', bearerFormat: 'JWT', in: 'header',}, 'access_token') 
4. 19-auth-jwt/src/main.ts has DocumentBuilder.addSecurityRequirements('access_token') 
5. Ensure Swagger uses swaggerOptions: { persistAuthorization: true} in 19-auth-jwt/src/main.ts while setting up the document
