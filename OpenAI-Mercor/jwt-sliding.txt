Due to increasing users and a lot of suspicious requests, we need to refine our authentication mechanism and implement something more robust. The current system has basic JWT authentication only. 

The following needs to be implemented:
In the 19-auth-jwt sample project, extend the JWT support to implement a sliding window JWT strategy for more enhanced authentication, making the active user session keep intact for a duration.
The idea of sliding window authentication is a method of managing user sessions and access tokens where the validity of the token is extended with each request made by the user, within a defined time window.  

Specifically:

1. Introduce a new JwtSlidingWindowStrategy extending PassportStrategy, similar to what we have for JWT, except this validates the deviceId for a user stored in memory or mock DB. Keep this new code in auth/strategies/jwt-sliding-window.strategy.ts
2. Validate in the JwtSlidingWindowStrategy if the device ID is the same.
3. Don't forget to extend AuthGuard for this new strategy. File: auth/auth.guard.ts
4. Feature flag this new strategy (SlidingWindowFlag) in the guard and only activate if the feature flag is turned on. You can set/get the feature flag value from environment variables.
5. Fallback to the default JWT Behavior if the feature flag is false.
6. Point to note, since we are utilising two JWT strategies now, we might need to create another strategy for Simple JWT (along with SlidingWindowJWT) i.e. auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts
7. For validate() method in these strategies, return from userService a default user for now. 

Include unit tests for the new flow, covering success and failure cases.

This feature must preserve existing login/token workflows and remain backward compatible with existing clients. We are introducing a feature-flagged Sliding Window JWT strategy that refreshes user session activity time on each authenticated request, based on a valid deviceId provided in the token and verified against stored device session data.
